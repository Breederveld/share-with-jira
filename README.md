# Share with Jira&reg;
An Universal Windows Application used to share content directly to Jira&reg; issues.

# Usage
Install the application from the Windows Store on your Windows 10 machine.
On any application with sharing functionality, like the Pictures App, hit the Share button and select the Share with Jira&reg; app.
A sidebar or window will show in which you can enter a Jira ID and optionally some comments, after hitting the "Send to Jira" button, any shared images or files will be added to the issue, along with any comments entered.

## Account set-up
The first time you share content to the app, you will be prompted to enter the Jira URL and your username and password. These will be stored locally so you don't need to enter them for subsequent sharing.
If you wish to change the details, just open the app from the start menu and you will be able to change your details from there.
